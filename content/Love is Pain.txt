Are we going insane?
Everything's still the same
But we know we can't go on this way
Time for sopmething new, what can we do and time is slipping away

Is there something wrong? have we waited too long?
tell me, cause I just don't know anymore
Don't know what is right cept the feeling at night when I'm holding you in my arms

And sometimes love is pain, and sometimes loss is gain
And we're scared when we think what we might have lost by playing the game.
   
And we've turned it around
What we lost we have found
It's scary to think that we almost threw it away
Now were holding tight, feeling more than right and it's getting better everyday.
