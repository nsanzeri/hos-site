	<p>Hey Nick, thanks again for doing a fantastic job last night.  Everybody keeps commenting on how good you guys are and I think all of the site-seeing people on other boats wanted to be on our boat!  Great job.

	<p>Thank you guys so so so much. We've heard nothing but rave reviews. You were the hit of the wedding! I'll be leaving an awesome post on your FB page and send you pics from our photographer when we get them. Thanks again, and you might be hearing from some of our guests about possibly playing their wedding as well. :)

	<p>Hi Nick!
	Jeff and I had an amazzzzing time! One of our friends was laughing the next morning saying that they were on the balcony smoking cigars during your break and when Jeff saw you were playing again he told them to put all their cigars out and come dance - the band is back!! Of course they did and followed the groom. Honestly everyone from the bartender to my family from Poland were just amazed at the diversity of your music and how great you sounded. He also gave me and the photographer grief for dragging him out for a photo during "an amazing song."
	We really can't thank you enough - we had an amazing time and are glad that you had fun too! (My uncle from Poland also wanted to thank you- he said he had never heard Led Zeppelin at a wedding and loved it! :)

	<p>Hey Nick - all of the surrounding neighborhood is asking for your information.They said they loved the free concert all night!  Thanks again and next time no crazy Brit - God Save the Queen!

	<p>Hooked on Sonics completely rocked our wedding reception! The
		dance floor was crowded with guests of all ages from the first chord
		to the encore--YES, THERE WAS AN ENCORE! The song selection flowed
		nicely and kept the balance between energy and intimacy. In short,
		this band can play any venue for any audience. For us, they were
		perfect; they will be perfect for you, too.</p>

	<span class='color2'><h3>Raquel and Dave (Wedding)</h3></span>
	<p>Hi! Everyone loved you guys, you did an amazing job! It was a
		blast and I couldn't have asked for a better night :) thank you sooooo
		much! We will refer you to everyone!</p>

	<span class='color2'><h3>Melissa and TJ (Wedding)</h3></span>	
		<p>
		Hooked on Sonics made our wedding reception come to life! I've never seen so many people dance at a wedding and enjoy the songs so much! Nick and I talked and emailed many times leading up to the wedding to discuss what types of songs I did and did not want to hear, in addition to working out the bridal party introductions. Guests to this day still rave about how awesome the band was. The guys were genuinely happy for my husband and I and helped make our wedding special.
		</p>
		
		
	<span class='color2'><h3>Lisa D. (Show attender)</h3></span>
	<p>We were all remarking what a perfect mix of old and new and
		well-mixed to be inclusive with a good flow. At no point did you
		'clear the floor', based on playing something that the crowd was
		disinterested in. For example: Maroon 5 'Moves like Jagger' segueing
		into the Stones song. Something that could have been corny worked to
		mix it up and have all involved.</p>

	<span class='color2'><h3>Paul M. (Party Thrower)</h3></span>
	<p>Nick!!! All the thanks go to you and the guys. You were amazing
		as I knew you would be. Everyone raved - and there are some picky
		people in that crowd. You guys made lots of new fans and friends and I
		couldn't be more grateful for you being the main reason it was such a
		special night for Lori - one we'll never forget. Paul M.</p>

	<span class='color2'><h3>Brandon W. (Wedding Client)</h3></span>
	<p>Hooked On Sonics played our wedding. From the first note they
		had our guests up off their seats and moving. The band was tight, well
		rehearsed, and professional. Their set moved along seamlessly as they
		shifted decades and styles. Many of our guests had played in wedding
		bands for decades and said, "Wow! These guys are amazing!" Two weeks
		after the wedding we are still getting great feedback about HOS! If
		you're looking for a wedding band that is tight, professional, & high
		energy, HOS should be your first call. - Brandon W.</p>

	<span class='color2'><h3>Lori M. (Birthday Girl)</h3></span>
	<p>You guys are so awesome during a regular gig I can't believe how
		you kicked it up to make my party so personal and special. Paul and I
		are forever fans. Thanks for an amazing and unforgettable night! -
		Lori M.</p>

	<span class='color2'><h3>Jane L. (NYE Party)</h3></span>
	<p>Nick. You were simply perfect in every way. All of our guests
		were still talking about the band and how amazing you were the next
		day at brunch. You are all so talented and were such fun. We had a
		fair range of ages and the comments about you were all the same. The
		best band ever. Thanks to all of you and your families for letting you
		be with us on NYE. We are so very grateful. Thanks for everything.</p>
	<br> <span class='color2'><h3>Rita and Kris (wedding
			clients)</h3></span>
	<p>Hi Nick! Kris and I just wanted to say thank you guys so much
		for your outstanding performance at our wedding! You guys sounded
		amazing! Honestly, I've never heard a live band sound so good. Kris
		talks about how awesome him every other day still. Nick, you have an
		amazing voice and you did a wonderful job emceeing. You guys were so
		laid back, cool and professional; a real pleasure. Some of our guests
		were so stiff and dry but you guys kept rocking out right in their
		faces! We loved it! Haha! They couldn't help but get out of their
		seats! We honestly couldn't have imagined better entertainment at our
		wedding than Hooked On Sonics. Thank you so much for everything :)</p>
	<br> <span class='color2'><h3>Marisa and Eric (wedding
			clients)</h3></span>
	<p>Hey Nick! It is fun rehashing the wedding with our friends and
		family and everyone has given great compliments on you guys, I even
		had someone ask about you as a referral so hopefully we can give you
		more business. But I know everyone had so much fun, we definitely had
		a blast, all thanks to you!</p>
	<br> <span class='color2'><h3>David and Chrissy
			(wedding clients)</h3></span>
	<p>Hooked on Sonics was amazing! Everyone was raving about your
		band! You had people dancing that I ever thought I'd live to see
		dance. You had me dancing more than I ever have (I dread dancing) and
		I was stone cold sober! I saw the guy using the flip video camera when
		you were playing. I would LOVE a copy of whatever footage you have of
		the night at East Bank Club. Would you burn the files to a disc and
		mail to us? I would love anything you have! I also provided with many
		referals to your website.</p>
	<br> <span class='color2'><h3>Joe and Lindsay (wedding
			clients)</h3></span>
	<p>We can't possibly express our sincere gratitude to you and the
		rest of the band! You were fabulous! The dance floor was packed, and
		our guests can't stop talking about you! You truly made the evening
		fun, energetic, and unique! THANK YOU!!!!!!!!! It truly means so much
		to us and Joe's family that Phil was able to play with you guys. That
		experience was absolutely priceless. If you need referrals or if any
		prospective wedding clients would like someone to talk to we'd be
		happy to do so!</p>
	<br> <span class='color2'><h3>Beth and Mike (wedding

		played like it too. Thanks for a great time!</p>
	<br> <span class='color2'><h3>Will L (wedding client)</h3></span>
	<p>Hooked On Sonics are not only one of the best live bands in
		Chicago, but they are the nicest guys you could ever meet. They made
		my wedding the biggest BASH of our lives and had the entire crowd on
		their feet the entire time! If you are looking for a band that can
		rock, funk out, and throw in some pop for good measure, this is YOUR
		band! Honestly words cannot do these guys justice, check them out live
		and you will see what i am talking about!!</p>
	<br> <span class='color2'><h3>Michael McDonald (Doobie
			Brothers)</h3></span>
	<p>You've got a really soulful voice and great rhythm. You don't
		see many bass player/singers that can hold it down like that. You guys
		are really great.</p>
	<br> <span class='color2'><h3>Beth C (club patron)</h3></span>
	<p>You guys rocked @ Kerry Piper 11/17! My first time seeing you -

	<p>Oh My God! Its been 24 hours since our daughter's wedding, and
		our phones have been ringing and text messaging all day with praise
		from the wedding guests about Nick, Gary, and Rich in the Hooked On
		Sonics Band. Everyone is raving about how cool it was to have such a
		kick-ass real rock band at a wedding instead of just a wedding band.
		Everyone danced and had the time of their lives. It was a mixed crowd
		of all ages, and it was so much fun that even 90 year old people and
		small children were rocking out. The wedding was a magical event due
		to the intensity of the band!</p>
