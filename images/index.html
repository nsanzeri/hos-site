                                                Nick is the lead vocalist and bass player and has been playing his whole life.  Some people come for his sense of humor but end up staying for the funk.  Musical activities include many recording and session dates, as well as playing in orchestras, society bands and speed metal outfits.  He was a music tutor at Columbia College, had a large roster of private guitar and bass students and was also a long time member of Libido Funk Circus, as well as first place winner in the Budweiser "cutting heads" bass solo competition.

Hard hitting as John Bonham and as detailed as any fusion master, Rich is definitely a drummer that has to be seen to be believed.

The man, the myth, the legend, Gary can lay down a funk groove one minute and then play an incendiary Van Halen solo note for note the next.  Always tasteful, an incredibly sweet human being, and a furiously shredding guitarist.

You are all so talented and were such fun.  We had a fair range of ages and the comments about you were all the same.  The best band ever!  Thanks to all of you and your families for letting you be with us on NYE.  We are so very grateful.  Thanks for everything.

                                        Well, first and foremost, you get the full Hooked On Sonics show with all the bells and whistles. The live band, as you see it on our site, comes with our own professional top notch sound system. Of course we provide all the necessary crew to run our production, as well fabulous stage lighting to transform the night into a showcase for dancing and music.

                                            We are pleased to offer the service of playing music via iPods before and in between our sets as well. This is our way of insuring that there is music playing during the duration of your event, as long as needed. This is a perfect opportunity to hear some of the music Hooked On Sonics does not perform (from swing to cocktail jazz).

                                            Take a look at the pictures on the site for a clear idea of the bands image. If you have a specific request, let us know. For more upscale events, the band can perform in suits and attire that is appropriate. Either way, count on the band always looking great -- as that is indeed part of their show.

                                        <p>
                                            We simply need a small space (preferably a stage) for us to perform on, with access to adequate power. The only other thing we need from you is an enthusiastic audience who is ready to dance the night away! We are an inclusive live music package, without any additional costs.
                                        </p>

                                            The group is happy to accommodate any of your musical requests. Please look over our song list, and we'd love to hear about your favorite songs from the list. If we play any songs that you don't care for, we'd like to know that as well. We can also learn songs that are not on our list, but this must be discussed well in advance of the performance.

                                        <p>
                                            Here are some of the most common questions we get about performing at weddings. If you're question isn't here or you need additional information, please don't hesitate to contact us.
                                        </p>
                                        <span class='color2'><h3>Can we hear you play?</h3></span>
                                        <p>
                                            Yes. We highly recommend that you attend a show that is open to the public so you can stay as long as you would like and meet the band. Check the shows page for schedules and be sure and say 'hi'.
                                        </p>
                                        <!--span class='color2'><h3>Can you provide live music for ceremony, cocktails and dinner? </h3></span>
                                        <p>
                                            Yes. We have several ala carte options that range from soloists (piano, guitar, etc.) to duos, trios and quartets. We also have two new adult contemporary options called a Night at the Piano Bar (piano and vocals ala Billy Joel, Elton John, etc.) and Speak Easy (An unplugged option ala John Mayer, Simon & Garfunkel, etc.).
                                        </p-->
                                        <span class='color2'><h3>I am concerned that a live band will be too loud. Are you able to play at a reasonable volume?</h3></span>
                                        <p>
                                            Absolutely. We have the experience, appropriate equipment, and technical and musical ability to make sure we are at the perfect sound level. Our use of in-ear monitors and modern sound reinforcement equipment also eliminates the need for noisy stage wedges that increase volume and are aesthetically unpleasing.
                                        </p>
                                        <span class='color2'><h3>What do you wear to weddings? </h3></span>
                                        <p>
                                            We usually wear black pants and dress shirts.  This could be dressed up to include ties and jackets.  Some people prefer that the band looks more like a "band", than just part of the wedding party, in which case we wear hip jeans and dress shirts that are a little less formal.  A clean but edgier look.
                                        </p>
                                        <span class='color2'><h3>Do you travel for weddings? </h3></span>
                                        <p>
                                            We certainly do, and we would love to travel to wherever you are having yours!  Contact us and we will discuss any details to make that possible.
                                        </p>
                                        <span class='color2'><h3>What is involved in the booking process? </h3></span>
                                        <p>
                                            Once we have agreed on the details, a signed contract from both parties and a non-refundable deposit ensures that the night of your wedding is secured.  It is very easy.
                                        </p>
                                        <span class='color2'><h3>Are you able to hold a date for me? </h3></span>
                                        <p>
                                            We do not have a formal hold process. Availability is given upon request, but the only way to secure a date is through a signed contract and deposit.
                                        </p>
                                        <span class='color2'><h3>Other than the contract price, is there anything else that I need to provide the band?</h3></span>
                                        <p>
                                            We request that any applicable parking fees be included as well as a meal at events where food is served. We can make these arrangements during the advanced planning process. The band will also need suitable space and access to electricity (see below)
                                        </p>
                                        <span class='color2'><h3>How much room and power do you need? </h3></span>
                                        <p>
                                            An area of 16 wide by 12 deep usually suffices. More area is always appreciated and less can usually be accommodated as well. We typically ask for 3 to 4 separate 20 amp (standard wall outlets) circuits near the stage, to ensure that the night runs without technical interruption due to a blown circuit breaker.
                                        </p>
                                        <span class='color2'><h3>Do we get to pick the songs we want to hear?</h3></span>
                                        <p>
                                            Most definitely!  Your preferences blended with our expertise will insure that you have a packed dance floor and a night that reflects your individual preferences!  Or you could leave the entire thing to us and rest assured that everyone from your grandparents to the youngest people in the room, as well as everyone in between, will have the time of their lives!

                                        <p>
                                            This is very serious matter. On your most important day everything must go right. With that said we have an under study for ever prosition of the highest caliber. It is rare that the need ever arises, but we are prepared to provide you with music in any eventuality.
                                        </p>
                                        <span class='color2'><h3>Can you accommodate a special guest performer at my wedding?</h3></span>
                                        <p>
                                            We can and we have!  Sometimes these are the best moments of the night.  Just let us know in advance so we could make that moment the most it could be!
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            Yes. On occasion, clients request that live music by the full band be interspersed throughout the night. This style of wedding is popular on the East Coast. We would love to do that for you if that is what you would like.  This can be a very exciting and stimulating way to plan your evening and you should definitely consider it!

Songs you may not have even thought you liked will become your new favorites once you hear them played by Hooked On Sonics, whether it be a song from the 60's or something that came out just yesterday.

                                            Nick. You were simply perfect in every way.  All of our guests were still talking about the band and how amazing you were the next day at brunch.  You are all so talented and were such fun.  We had a fair range of ages and the comments about you were all the same.  The best band ever!  Thanks to all of you and your families for letting you be with us on NYE.  We are so very grateful.  Thanks for everything.

                                            Hooked on Sonics was amazing! Everyone was raving about your band!  You had people dancing that I never thought I'd live to see dance.  You had me dancing more than I ever have (I dread dancing) and I was stone cold sober!

                                            Nick. You were simply perfect in every way.  All of our guests were still talking about the band and how amazing you were the next day at brunch.  You are all so talented and were such fun.  We had a fair range of ages and the comments about you were all the same.  The best band ever.  Thanks to all of you and your families for letting you be with us on NYE.  We are so very grateful.  Thanks for everything.

Honestly, I've never heard a live band sound so good.  Kris talks about how awesome him every other day still. Nick, you have an amazing voice and you did a wonderful job emceeing. You guys were so laid back, cool and professional; a real pleasure. Some of our guests were so stiff and dry but you guys kept rocking out right in their faces! We loved it! Haha! They couldn't help but get out of their seats!  We honestly couldn't have imagined better entertainment at our wedding than Hooked On Sonics. Thank you so much for everything :)

                                            Hooked on Sonics was amazing! Everyone was raving about your band!  You had people dancing that I ever thought I'd live to see dance.  You had me dancing more than I ever have (I dread dancing) and I was stone cold sober!
                                            I saw the guy using the flip video camera when you were playing.  I would LOVE a copy of whatever footage you have of the night at East Bank  Club.  Would you burn the files to a disc and mail to us?  I would love anything you have!
                                            I also provided with many referals to your website.

                                            Hooked On Sonics are not only one of the best live bands in Chicago, but they are the nicest guys you could ever meet. They made my wedding the biggest BASH of our lives and had the entire crowd on their feet the entire time! If you are looking for a band that can rock, funk out, and throw in some pop for good measure, this is YOUR band! Honestly words cannot do these guys justice, check them out live and you will see what i am talking about!!

                                            Oh My God! Its been 24 hours since our daughter's wedding, and our phones have been ringing and text messaging all day with praise from the wedding guests about Nick, Gary, and Rich in the Hooked On Sonics Band. Everyone is raving about how cool it was to have such a kick-ass real rock band at a wedding instead of just a wedding band. Everyone danced and had the time of their lives. It was a mixed crowd of all ages, and it was so much fun that even 90 year old people and small children were rocking out. The wedding was a magical event due to the intensity of the band!

                                            You could pay a lot more for a band and not have anywhere near the good time that you will with Hooked on Sonics.  We love playing so much that we want everyone to experience the pleasure of having Hooked On Sonics play for them and we try to make every event a win/win for everyone involved.

                                            Although there are really no special power requirements, two seperate circuits that are at least 15 amps will ensure that the night stays running smooth and that we don't cause a breaker to malfunction.  If this isn't possible, we can adjust the type of equipment we use to help ensure that the night goes smoothly.
