		<b>12/31/2006</b><span class="style17"> The Kerry Piper</span> This was our 7th date of 2006 at the Kerry Piper and it was absolutely great as usual.  The whole staff and crew there feels like family to us now and they always show us the love and we can't wait to play their in 2007.  We had the help of Brian Abraham on Drums filling in for a travelling Rich.<br>
		<b>12/09/2006</b><span class="style17"> Gunther's</span> What can I say about this one?  This was an overwhelming turnout.  Thanks to Jason from Secondhand Smoke and his crew and all of the Cat folks and everyone else.  We can't wait to go back there.<br>
		<b>12/08/2006</b><span class="style17"> Piece</span> Rick and Adelle, Bunny and Liz and Jeff and Amelia and everyone else made this a great night.  Even Brian filling in on drums had some friends come out.<br>
		<b>11/25/2006</b><span class="style17"> Harry's</span> This was an awesome time.  Even though I busted my low E and didn't have a replacement, tying a knot in the string worked like a charm.  Thanks to Ricco and everyone who came out and made it an awesome time!<br>
		<b>11/17/2006</b><span class="style17"> The Kerry Piper</span> This might have been the most fun we've had there ever.  Michelle, Christine, Linda, Beth, Debbie and everyone else was there dancing the night away.  A big thanks goes out to Sophia for showing us the love all the time, everytime!<br>
		<b>11/11/2006</b><span class="style17"> Cheapseats</span> Thanks to Jerry and Julie and all the new friends we have made out there (the Kansas City friends).  This was the best time out there yet. This was the fabulous debut of the new lighting and wow was it impressive!<br>
		<b>11/04/2006</b><span class="style17"> Muldoon's</span> I forgot my wireless but it was still off the hook!  The fog machine was happening too.  Lot's of ice water and oil and electricity mixed, but I guess it's UL approved.  We love this place and are making plans to be there often so we'll see you there soon.<br>
		<b>10/14/2006</b><span class="style17"> The Kerry Piper</span> The whole crew was out in force this night and this is turning into one of my favorite places we play! Small, tight and outta sight.  Thanks to everyone who came out and we can't wait to see you in Nov.<br>
		<b>10/07/2006</b><span class="style17"> NextWave Inc Party</span> This was a great time. Thanks to Harold and Kelly for hosting it, Robert for organizing it, Then Again for letting us use their gear, Matt from Team-Rockit for playing some drums, Dave for the awesome pics, and everybody else for just being themselves!  Together we worked some rock n' roll miracles!<br>
		<b>09/23/2006</b><span class="style17"> Sideouts</span> The class of 86 definitely knows how to rock and it was great to Mani, Ilona and Lisa and Janet and Tony.  But Jerry let us go early for good behavior.  Some live music venues just aren't in the mood for live music all the time I guess!  It was a real ego boost to say the least.<br>
		<b>09/22/2006</b><span class="style17"> The Kerry Piper</span> Thanks again to Missy and Steve for bringing out their whole crew, and especially to Steve for not arresting me.  Also, Gary and Dan and all of the other folks who hung the whole night with us and made it so darn fun.  Maybe it was too fun if that's possible!<br>
		<b>09/15/2006</b><span class="style17"> Tommy Nevin's Pub</span>A last minute add that was great thanks to the folks from A.C.Neilsen(Gia and Camay) and especially my main homies Jeff and John, with Lisa and Emilia.  Next time we won't be playing til our fingers fall off though.  Just until around 12:30 or 1am.<br>
		<b>09/09/2006</b><span class="style17"> Blarney Stone in Oak Forest.</span> The south side is crazy and this was one of the craziest nights ever!  There must have been something in the beer, or maybe just people that have had it for the first time, because we've never witnessed behavior quite like that.  We definitely made some new friends at this place.<br>
		<b>09/08/2006</b><span class="style17"> Muldoon's.</span> This was definitely one of our best nights as well as Muldoon's!  Thanks so much to Cat logistics, the Stark Raving Dad contingent as well as my friends from CCC and all of my cousins and their friends.  We can't wait to get back and help their bar staff pay their way through college!  <br>
		<b>08/20/2006</b><span class="style17"> Bandito Barney's Beach Club.</span> This place got off the hook!  We look forward to going back there, but it may have to wait until next year.  A big shout out to Phil and all of his friends, downtown Mike Brown for the hookup and all of our new friends - Carrie, Lisa, Angelika, Frank, Kenny, Gail, Connie, Jim and all the rest who were there.  Thanks for a great time! <br>
		<b>08/19/2006</b><span class="style17"> Craig and Jackie's Wedding.</span> Wow! We can't thank Craig and Jackie enough for having us play and thanks to Joey behind the bar for being the best.  Also a shout out to Becca and Bill, John the best man, Tara from AZ, Janet and of course my good ole Beth and Chris!  It was a lot of fun down by the fire too.<br>
		<b>08/18/2006</b><span class="style17"> The Kerry Piper.</span> A great start to our weekend.  Rhonda the dancing machine was there, as well as Steve (Tom Cruise) and Missy (aka Jill).  Also Bob (Dustin Hoffman) and Jeanette.  It was regular celebrity packed event if look alikes count!<br>
		<b>07/22/2006</b><span class="style17"> Duke O'Brien's</span> in Crystal Lake.  This was the great time I knew it would be!  Everybody came out and everybody was not afraid to get up and get down.  Thanks to Jeff who just seems like a genuinely nice guy, and everyone else who came out.<br>
		<b>07/22/2006</b><span class="style17"> Grace St. Bar</span> Hung out with Robin and Erica for a while playing acoustic and then lost track of Bill who was travelling with me.  I'm glad you made it home my man.<br>
		<b>07/15/2006</b><span class="style17"> Cheapseat's.</span> Debbie and Jerry and the rest of the staff are going to make us famous down there if it kills them.  Some good male dancing but not too much bonding went on down there.  I appreciate the enthusiasm for the music.  I just don't need to know all of the other personal info!<br>
		<b>07/14/2006</b><span class="style17"> Clearwater Theater.</span> A total blast!  Thanks to Earl, LaFeet, Christina and the staff there as well as the Dickey Pimpkins and Liberty's teeth.  Matt sure learned a lot over at Music City!<br>
		<b>06/23/2006</b><span class="style17"> Kerry Piper.</span> Once we overcame a small technical difficulty it went great. Our new lights looked fantastic.<br>
		<b>06/02/2006</b><span class="style17"> Muldoon's.</span> This was a great time and a great turn out especially due to all of my friends from CCC and CCC west. Also a big shout out to Mike from Stark Raving Dad (thanks for the drinks)<br>
		<b>05/27/2006</b><span class="style17"> Sideouts.</span> Thanks to Chuck and Craig and Ed. The power outage earlier in the night didn't stop this from being a fantastic and patriotic night.<br>
		<b>05/26/2006</b><span class="style17"> Gunther's.</span> A great time opening for Team Rockit. Lauren and her crowd there were awesome.<br>
		<b>05/13/2006</b><span class="style17"> Good Times Pub.</span> Thanks to Jim D., Chad and his crew, M and M and everyone else for coming out. Also thanks to Voodoo Moon.<br>
		<b>04/14/2006</b><span class="style17"> The Kerry Piper.</span> An emergency trip to Radio Shack and Nancy's co-workers and Sophia and her staff made this a night to remember.<br>
		<b>02/18/2006</b><span class="style17"> Chicago Loop</span> in Streamwood. Thanks to Atillio and everyone that came out. Even though the weather was frigid, it was still a very warm night!<br>
		<b>02/11/2006</b><span class="style17"> Cheapseats</span> in Streator. We love this place and were keeping it rural for the folks out there which is really hard to do sometimes! We'll see you all again real soon!<br>

		<b>01/28/2006</b><span class="style17"> Cubby Bear North.</span> A great time and turnout! Thanks to Mike Brown and the Dickey Pimpkins for inviting us to play and being real damn good and cool to boot.<br>
		<b>01/21/2006</b><span class="style17"> St. Charlie's Pub.</span> Record attendance and off the hook dancing. Thanks to Dave, Sue, Joel and Beth and our friends from Orazio's, to name a few, for coming out!<br>
		<b>01/06/2006</b><span class="style17"> Bungalow Joe's.</span> Got to see Drum Bob and Laura and had a great time. Maybe they need a couple of more smoke eater's in there though.<br>
