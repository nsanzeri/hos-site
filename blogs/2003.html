		<b>12/27/2003</b><span class="style17">  Pop's Pizza</span> in Roselle. This turned out to be a great night with guest appearances by Joe of TEAM-ROCKIT. and Jay Billon!<br>
		<b>11/21/2003</b><span class="style17">  North Beach</span> in Downer's Grove. A whole lot of dancing took place that night. Thanks to everyone from Conway Logistics for coming out!<br>
		<b>11/01/2003</b><span class="style17">  Rookie's</span> in St Charles. Very nice for the day after Halloween with our very scary special guests, Jagged Rust. I know, that is actually their name.<br>
		<b>10/25/2003</b><span class="style17">  Famous Freddie's</span> In Mt Prospect. Broken windows aside, a very fun place to dance and prance. Took many chances busting out all the new material.<br>
		<b>09/13/2003</b><span class="style17">  Caio for Now</span> in Foxlake. Again this wasn't HOS, just Gary and Nick helping out a drummer in need named Casey. This may happen in the future again also.<br>
		<b>09/12/2003</b><span class="style17">  Southwind</span> on 39th and Harlem. This wasn't HOS, just Gary and Nick helping out a drummer in need named Casey.<br>
		<b>09/05/2003</b><span class="style17">  Rory's</span> in Addison. Opened for the awesome Bonesugar and rocked Rich's friends mightily.<br>
		<b>08/30/2003</b><span class="style17">  Sean Kayley's</span> aka Confetti's. This was a great way to spend the holiday weekend! A darn good time with some darn cool guys in Strutter and as always our buddy Joe behind the bar.<br>

		<b>06/14/2003</b><span class="style17">  Rookies</span> in St. Charles. Dave "Bones" Martinez and rest of his gang made this a damn good time. We got to break out everything in the playbook.<br>
		<b>05/31/2003</b><span class="style17">  Half-Times</span> with Jeff's Last Gig. In spite of complaints about JLG's excessive volume ( which is unusual for a rock club ) the show was great.<br>
		<b>05/10/2003</b><span class="style17">  Longshots</span> with 28IF a rockin band. Shooting pool and drinking while listening to hard rock has never been so fun!<br>
		<b>05/03/2003</b><span class="style17">  Confetti's</span> with Guns and Roses tribute NightTrain. This was the second time we've played with these guys. They kicked some ass as usual and are very cool to boot.<br>
